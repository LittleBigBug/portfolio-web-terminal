<b>Welcome!</b><br/>
My name is Ethan Jones and I am a Software Developer and Systems Admin.<br/>
For more about me, check 'about.txt'<br/>
<hr/>
My portfolio is based on an ubuntu terminal and I wrote it from scratch with javascript.<br/>
If you are familiar with this sort of terminal, you are welcome to use the commands, otherwise you can just click those links.<br/>
For a list of commands, type '<a href="#" class="helpcmd" onclick="clickCmd('help')">help</a>'<br/>
<br/>
If you want to mess with this terminal yourself, <a href="https://github.com/littlebigbug/portfolio-web-terminal">You can grab a copy of the source code from the github repository</a>.
